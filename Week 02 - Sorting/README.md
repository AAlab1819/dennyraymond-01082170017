  2. after that i do compare :
     - The first condition is if the first data not zero and there are 2 more data that have same value, then the answer is -1

## - Problem 230A - Dragons -
  So for this problem we need to declare kirito and dragons strength, and kirito strength equals _s_.
  the condition we need to figure is , when kirito start dueling with the dragon,
  we need to think about the kirito's strength is not greater than the dragon's strength, then kirito will lose the match.
  But if Kirito's strength is greater than the dragon's strength, then he defeats the dragon and gets a bonus strength.
  for this problem i use gnome sort, but i modified a bit so it can sort 2 array in one time.
  the other explanation you can find it directly in **Solutions** .
