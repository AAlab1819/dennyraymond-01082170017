## - Roy and Trending Topics -
For this problem we need to find the 5 topics that go trendings, which can be calculated
according to the following rules:

1. When a topic is mentioned in a 'Post', its z-score is increased by 50.
2. A 'Like' on such a Post, increases the z-score by 5.
3. A 'Comment' increases z-score by 10.
4. A 'Share' causes an increment of 20.

First we get the initial score "Z" which will be added with the total of the score get from that rules.
so the solution is we collect the IDs and the "New Score" ( which get from old score + total score from the rules ), and sorted it. after that we need to find which is the bigger from the "New Score", but if there are "New Score" that have same value, the we use the ID's as comparison which go first 

  Complexity : O(nlogn)
