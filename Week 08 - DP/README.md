## - 433 B - Kuriyama Mirai's Stones -
For this problem we need to calculated how much is the sum of l and r, that we can get from the type of the questions, there are two type, type 1 and 2. 

Type 1 is the sum of the stone's cost from l to r in sorted array number 
Type 2 is the sum of the stone's cost from l to r in unsorted array number 

The sum we can get with this calculation : 

<pre>  
If Type 1 :
 sum = cost (right side number position - 1) - cost (left side number position - 2)
If Type 2 :
 check if the right side number position == 1 :
  then Sum = sortedCostArray ( right side number - 1 )
 else 
   Sum = sortedCostArray (right side number - 1) - sortedCostArray (left side number - 2)   
</pre>
