## - PROBLEM 268B - Buttons -
For this problem we need to calculated the worst case, which is how many times Manao need to try the combination button to open the lock.
lets say the number of button locks is __3__
so the _n_ = 3
so everytime he try to press for the first time, it will cost 1 mistake, n-1.
and everytime he do press the button again he will try to press other button (the correct one), then we get this pattern (n-1)*i. (n-i) are stand for remain button he need to try to press and *i stand for the  previous number sequence to press.
