## - PROBLEM 469A - I Wanna Be the Guy -
  
  The solution for this problem is quite simple.
  we just need to assign the level number that X and Y can solved in an array, then mark in "passed" if they can solved all the levels.
  So, 
  1. first i declare all the variables, then assign the total level that X and Y need to passed, and set the unsolved to __false__
  2. second is i declare the all the level to 1, it indicates that level is not pass yet.
  3. third i assign the total level of X can do and which level that X can do, same with Y.
  4. fourth i check if there are unsolved levels remain, by assign the all the unsolved level to __True__ if found level that still      equals to __1__.
  
  Complexity :
  Average case: θ(n)
  Worst case: O(n)
  Best case: Ω(n)
